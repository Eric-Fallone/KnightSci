# KnightSci
Unity based project connecting stars in the night sky. 

I was a team leader/gameplay programmer for a semester long project for the class Game Production at Rutgers New Brunswick. 

The object of the game is to uncover all of the constilations hidden in a field of stars. My role as a team leader was to create burndown charts for keeping track of work done during sprints and to lead a weekly stand up scrum meeting. My role as gameplay programmer was to create the gameplay loop and to integrate assets (art and sound) created from team members.
